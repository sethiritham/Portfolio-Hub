# Portfolio-Hub

## Phase 1: C# and App Development (September - October)

###  C# Weather App üå¶Ô∏è
- [ ] Research & Learning:
  - [ ] Complete a C# basics tutorial.
  - [ ] Learn how to make API calls in .NET (`HttpClient`).
  - [ ] Choose a UI framework (.NET MAUI is a good choice).
  - [ ] Find a free weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
- [ ] Development:
  - [ ] Set up the project structure.
  - [ ] Build the core logic to fetch weather data.
  - [ ] Design and build a simple UI to display the current weather.
  - [ ] Add features: 5-day forecast, search by city.
- [ ] Polishing:
  - [ ] Handle errors (no internet, invalid city).
  - [ ] Add comments to the code.
  - [ ] Write a `README.md` file.
  - [ ] Push the final project to GitHub.

## Phase 2: Game Development Foundations (November - December)

### 2D Godot Game (using C#) üöÄ
- [ ] Research & Learning:
  - [ ] Complete the official Godot "Getting Started" docs (C# path).
  - [ ] Decide on a simple game concept (e.g., top-down shooter, simple platformer).
  - [ ] Find or create basic art assets.
- [ ] Development:
  - [ ] Create the main player character and controls.
  - [ ] Build one complete game level.
  - [ ] Implement core game mechanics (e.g., shooting, jumping, collecting items).
  - [ ] Add a simple UI (score, health).
- [ ] Polishing:
  - [ ] Add sound effects and music.
  - [ ] Fix bugs.
  - [ ] Build the game to a playable executable.
  - [ ] Push the final project to GitHub with a great README and screenshots.

## Phase 3: Semester Break C++ Deep Dive (January)

### C++ 3D Software Renderer üßä
- [ ] Research & Learning:
  - [ ] Refresh on linear algebra (vectors, matrices).
  - [ ] Study modern C++ concepts (RAII, smart pointers, STL).
  - [ ] Follow a "Renderer from Scratch" tutorial series (e.g., on YouTube).
- [ ] Development:
  - [ ] Set up a C++ build environment (CMake is standard).
  - [ ] Write code to parse a simple 3D model file (like .obj).
  - [ ] Implement matrix transformations for camera and perspective.
  - [ ] Write the core rendering loop to output an image file.
My future plan to build a robust portfolio!
